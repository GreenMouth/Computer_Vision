Median filtering:
Median filtering is good at eliminating salt and pepper noise
It turns out that it does a pretty good job of preserving edges in an image.
The pixels on the edge of an object in an image end up as values that are already present in that section of the image.

Gaussian filtering:
Gaussian blurring takes the average of the values around a pixel, after scanning through all pixels in the image, 
each one ends up as a blend of all the colors around it, and it will end up doing exactly what itâ€™s name says: blur
