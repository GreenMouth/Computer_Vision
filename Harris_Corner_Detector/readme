Harris Corner Detector:
Harris Corner Detector is a corner detection operator that is commonly used in computer vision algorithms 
to extract corners and infer features of an image. 
It was first introduced by Chris Harris and Mike Stephens in 1988 upon the improvement of Moravec's corner detector.
