Take Great Pictures!!
"Shutter Speed", "Aperture" & "ISO" are 3 most important things of Photography, also called 'Exposure Traingle'.
New DSLRs have 'auto' mode which means based on lighting conditions camera automatically figures out what should be these 3 values.
HOWEVER, by controlling these 3 things manually you can take better pictures using the same camera.
Knowing how to adjust the settings of the camera when needed, helps to get the best out of your camera and push it to its limits to take great photographs.


1. Shutter Speed: ***********
The length of time a camera shutter is open to expose light into the camera sensor. 
Shutter speeds are typically measured in fractions of a second, when they are under a second. 
SLOW shutter speeds allow more light into the camera sensor and are used for low-light and night photography, 
while FAST shutter speeds help to freeze motion. 
Examples of shutter speeds: 1/15 (1/15th of a second), 1/30, 1/60, 1/125.

It is amount of time your camera spends taking a picture.
The longest allowable shutter speed tends to be around 30 seconds (overexposed) & shortest is 1/8000 second (underexposed).
Underexposed images are usually too dark & overexposed images are too bright. Find balance of shutter speed!!

Motion blur: A longer shutter speed (e.g. 5 sec) might also capture a person walking by (featureless streak in image), 
since they aren’t in one place long enough for the long exposure to capture them sharply.

A quick shutter speed (such as 1/1000 second) does a much better job freezing motion in your photo. 
You can photograph a waterfall at 1/1000 second and see individual droplets frozen in midair.

Sharp Image: Pick a shutter speed that is quick enough to freeze any movement.

If your subject is moving very quickly, you’ll need a fast shutter speed. 
If your subject is standing still, or only moving very slowly, you can get away with a longer shutter speed.

To avoid blur image, choose a quicker shutter speed.

 
2. Aperture: ***********
A whole within a lens through which light travels into the camera body.
The larger the hole, the more light passes to camera sensor.
If the aperture is very small, the depth of field is large, while if the aperture is large, the depth of field is small.
Aperture is expressed in 'f' numbers (also called focal ratio). 
Examples of f-numbers are: f/1.4, f/2.0, f/2.8, f/4.0, f/5.6, f/8.0.

Aperture is very similar to the “pupil” of your camera lens. 
Just like the pupil in your eye, it can open or shrink to change the amount of light that passes through.

Aperture blades work a lot like the pupil in your eyes. At night, your pupils dilate so you can see things more easily. 
The same is true for aperture. When it is dark, you can open the aperture blades in your lens and let in more light.

Typically, the largest aperture you can set will be something like f/1.4, f/1.8, f/2, f/2.8, f/3.5, f/4, or f/5.6. 
The smallest aperture on most lenses is something like f/16, f/22, or f/32.

The larger your aperture, the brighter your photo – the more light you capture. (Night Photography needs more light)

The other important effect of aperture is on 'depth of field'. Changing the depth of field in an image will alter the way it looks completely.

To be specific, small apertures (like f/11 or f/16) give you a large depth of field (front to back appear sharp)
Large apertures (like f/1.4 or f/2.8) capture a much thinner depth of field, with a shallow focus effect (Portrait Image) 
They are ideal if you are trying to isolate just a small part of your subject, making everything else blurred.



3. ISO: ***********
A way to brighten your photos if you can't use a longer shutter speed or a wider aperture.
A lower ISO number representing a darker image, while higher numbers mean a brighter image.
However, raising your ISO comes at a cost. As the ISO rises, so does the visibility of graininess/noise in your images. 
Examples of ISO: 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600.

When you raise your ISO, your photos will be brighter, but you’ll also emphasize grain (otherwise known as noise) 
and discolored pixels in the images along the way.

A higher ISO will be necessary when your exposure is too dim and you have no other way to capture a bright enough photograph.
At higher numbers, your photos will be brighter, but you also will see more and more noise.
Although there is some noise at ISO 1600 if you zoom into the pixels, a noisy photo is better than a picture that is too dark to use.
If your exposure (shutter speed and aperture) will not result in a bright enough photo, it is time to raise the ISO.

Exposure:
In photography, exposure is the amount of light which reaches your camera sensor or film. 
It is a crucial part of how bright or dark your pictures appear.
ISO is not a part of Exposure.

Getting the proper exposure for a photo is about balancing those three settings so the rest of the photo looks good, from depth of field to sharpness.


EXIF Data:
1. Expensive option: Buy an DSLR camera in which you can control Shutter Speed, Aperture & ISO
2. Cheap option: Use iPhone & download app (e.g. EXIF Metadata) from App store
